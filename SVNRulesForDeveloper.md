# SVN Rules for RailsERP #

---

It is very important that the SVN trunk are very stable and can be used, because if not all developer can have many trouble.

  * Only check in new Features if they are testes from you.

  * Update before you check-in changes.

  * If Conflicts by check-in the code speak with Marcel Joist over it!

  * Not two persons work on the same roadmap task

  * All changes on the code must be a task on the roadmap or a Bug fix witch was find  and mask as accept on googlecode

  * New features or functional change on old features must be in the Roadmap.

  * If a version is stable we make a Tag of it!

  * By the check-in process make good description that all know what is happened

  * Do not check in files or pictures ... -> From Database Entry's because we have 1 GB spache on the SVN!

  * Do not check in database.yml and environment.rb, because all other get problems by checkout or update.
